# BTP_SignalAnalysis

Final year project for BEng Electrical and Electronic Engineering.

This is a signal analysis project based on Doppler methods of measuring brain pulsation velocity.
The goal of the project was to document the Hoeks et. al 1994 Subsample Volume algorithm, as well as provide any additional improvements.

In this repository, you may find:
- Relevant code files, in which lie algorithms of measuring brain tissue velocity from BTP data
- Progress report submitted in time for Dec2023 deadline
- Final project report submitted in time for Apr2024 deadline

Note: These code files are part of a larger GUI 'BrainTV', these files do not work in isolation. Those files are under ownership of the university professors and will not be shared here.
Sorry to the folks trying to copy <3
